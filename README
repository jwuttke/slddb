This is the development version for the SLD Database. To test on you local machine:

1. Install python3 packages for periodictable, flask, bokeh
2. Set environment variables:
    - PYTHONPATH to directory of repository
	- FLASK_APP = flaskr
3. Create database with "python3 create_database.py"
4. Run "flask run" and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/

The database is already filled with all elements and the densities for those. SLD calculation should therefore work. 
Up to now there is no interface to enter data, yet. This can, however, be done through the python interface manually:
	$ from slddb import *
	$ db=SLDDB(DB_FILE)
	$ db.add_material('test', 'Fe2O3', density=7.8)
	
You can also add additional fields to that entry, currently limited to: E_x, FU_volume, HR_fomula, SLD_n, SLD_x, description.
Database queary from python is done using db.search_material(field=value).

There is also a simple Qt5 interface that can be started with "slddbqt.py".
